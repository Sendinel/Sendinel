;------------------------------ JITTER BUFFER CONFIGURATION --------------------------
; jbenable = yes		; Enables the use of a jitterbuffer on the receiving side of an
				; OSS channel. Defaults to "no". An enabled jitterbuffer will
				; be used only if the sending side can create and the receiving
				; side can not accept jitter. The OSS channel can't accept jitter,
				; thus an enabled jitterbuffer on the receive OSS side will always
				; be used if the sending side can create jitter.

; jbmaxsize = 200		; Max length of the jitterbuffer in milliseconds.

; jbresyncthreshold = 1000	; Jump in the frame timestamps over which the jitterbuffer is
				; resynchronized. Useful to improve the quality of the voice, with
				; big jumps in/broken timestamps, usualy sent from exotic devices
				; and programs. Defaults to 1000.
; jbimpl = fixed		; Jitterbuffer implementation, used on the receiving side of an OSS
				; channel. Two implementations are currenlty available - "fixed"
				; (with size always equals to jbmax-size) and "adaptive" (with
				; variable size, actually the new jb of IAX2). Defaults to fixed.

; jblog = no			; Enables jitterbuffer frame logging. Defaults to "no".
